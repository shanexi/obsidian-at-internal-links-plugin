# Obsidian @Mention Links Plugin

An Obsidian plugin that enables `@mention` syntax as an alternative to `[[wikilinks]]` for internal note linking.

## Features

### üîó Alternative Link Syntax
Use `@path/to/note` instead of `[[path/to/note]]` to create internal links.

**Examples:**
- `@my-note` ‚Üí links to "my-note"
- `@folder/note` ‚Üí links to "note" in "folder"
- `@../sibling-note` ‚Üí links to note in parent directory

### ‚ú® Native Autocomplete
Type `@` to trigger Obsidian's native file suggestion dropdown, identical to the `[[` experience.

- **Smart filtering**: Filters files as you type
- **Relevance sorting**: Files starting with your query appear first
- **Full path display**: Shows relative paths for files in different folders
- **Keyboard navigation**: Use arrow keys and Enter/Tab to select

### üëÅÔ∏è Hover Preview
Hover over `@mention` links with **Cmd (Mac)** or **Ctrl (Windows/Linux)** pressed to see a preview popover, just like regular wikilinks.

- Works with both "hover first, then press key" and "press key, then hover"
- Shows full note preview in a popover
- Click to navigate or Cmd/Ctrl+click to open in new pane

### üé® Consistent Styling
`@mention` links are styled identically to `[[wikilinks]]`:
- Same color and underline
- Same hover states
- Same visual feedback

### üîÑ Format Conversion Commands
Two commands for converting between link formats:

1. **Convert [[wikilink]] to @mention**: Converts selected `[[]]` links to `@` format
2. **Convert @mention to [[wikilink]]**: Converts selected `@` links to `[[]]` format

Access via Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+P).

### üìù Works Everywhere
- ‚úÖ **Edit mode (Live Preview)**: Links render and are clickable while editing
- ‚úÖ **Reading mode**: Full support for rendered documents
- ‚úÖ **Relative paths**: Automatically calculates correct relative paths based on current file location

## Technical Details

### Architecture
